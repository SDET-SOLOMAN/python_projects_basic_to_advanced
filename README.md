# python_projects_basic_to_advanced

30 Days of creating one small 'app' 'project' per day, from very basics to advanced Python coding.

The idea of this 30 days code challange was taken from a Udemy instructor Dr. Angela Yu, here is the link for her Udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/

I believe that I already have good coding skills in Python, but practice makes it better, so I have decided to start this challenge on Sept 20, 2022 to October 19th, 2022.

Happy Coding :)
